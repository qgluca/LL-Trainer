# LL-Trainer

Rubik's cube last layer trainer (OLL and PLL)

This application is based on the old Badmephisto and Zarxrax's OLL/PLL trainers.
I used their applications for years on Windows and on Linux and Mac with WINE.
When WINE stopped working on Mac, I decided to create a native application for this operating system.

The application is written in SwiftUI. The graphical interface follows the style of the old trainers (and it reuses the images of the cases).
